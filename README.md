## ðŸ“¦ Installation
### Requirements
- In order for your `Screen` implementations to be able to use the `Content` DSL function, you must have [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) set up in your application, with [`scoped` definitions](https://insert-koin.io/docs/reference/koin-core/scopes/) for all your `CarthasViewModel` implementations.

Add the following to your `libs.versions.toml` file:

```toml
[versions]
carthas-common = "0.6.0"

[libraries]
carthas-common = { module = "com.carthas:common", version.ref = "carthas-common" }
```

Then, include it in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.carthas.common)
}
```
